# Deploy & Optimize Microsoft Sentinel 

**Microsoft Sentinel** is a scalable, cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) that delivers an intelligent and comprehensive solution for **SIEM and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)**. Microsoft Sentinel provides cyberthreat detection, investigation, response, and proactive hunting, with a bird's-eye view across your enterprise.

Microsoft Sentinel also natively incorporates proven Azure services, like **Log Analytics** and **Logic Apps**, and enriches your investigation and detection with **AI**. It uses both Microsoft's threat intelligence stream and also enables you to bring your own threat intelligence.
